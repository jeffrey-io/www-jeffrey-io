I love food more than I should. In 2016, I decided that it was time to stop fucking around with it. I am a fat man, and my goal is to be a buff non-fat man.

Originally, I started this journey in 2010 and over the course of two years lost over a hundred pounds while getting more fit. This made life way better, but I wasn't done. Then I got super depressed, and I gained fifty back over four years.

# Plan

The first goal is to lose as much weight as I can as fast as I can. The second goal is to redefine my relationship with food. This is the really hard part because this has to extend past 2016 until I'm ready to die. I think there are three diets I need to decide on.

## Diet 1: Extreme weight loss

I think this is what I am doing now which is basically meat + brocolli

## Diet 2: Maintainence + health

This diet is entirely about maintaining health, not being hungry, and enjoying life a touch more than diet 1. I am not here yet.

## Diet 3: The Cheat Day

I need to develop a rigorous and refined list of bad foods that I can eat at a semi-rare occurence. I think I need to combine the cheat day with social events. Ideally, I'll need lots of control over the menu because the foods I want to eat must be "worth dying for". So far the list of food worth dying for:

* Mora's Peanut Butter Moreo Ice cream
* Jake's Pickup: Mac and Cheese
* Jake's Pickup: Button role + protein (burger, pulled pork, or eggs)... it's just soo good
* Via Rosa 11: Any Pasta + Any Sauce
* Jake's Pickup: Pumpkin Pie made by Jake's Mom

# 2016 Progress

Didn't eat much 'explicit' sugar beyond what was in the house after December (i.e. no Cookies or ice cream). Weight didn't change.

## February

Worked with Ubbe, lost ~25 pounds on a a new diet and exercise.

## March

Set back progress by a week with a cheat day, and then lost an additional X pounds.
