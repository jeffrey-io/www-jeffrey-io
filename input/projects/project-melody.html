		Melody is a library that I've started in my goal of making a high quality open source Music XML renderer. My intent is that melody will power some new applications that I would like to breath life into.
          </p>
	  <p> The biggest impact of Melody, so far, has been my learning to read music well enough not to need Melody anymore. Go Figure.</p>
