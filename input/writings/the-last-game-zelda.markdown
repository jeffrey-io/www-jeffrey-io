Something strange has happened within the last year. My desire to play games has dropped to all time low. The only game I am looking forward to is the next Zelda Game on the Wii U. When it comes out, I may go out to buy a Wii U and the game to play them. This may be the last game I ever play.

I'm getting old, or games are becoming derivative.
