		Since a bunch of my work has been focused on 2D geometry in Java, this is my 2D vector library. Unlike other approaches, I went down what some could call a premature optimization route. Vector Register is essentially a bunch of generated code for doing math over multiple vectors contained in a single class. The reason that I do this is to avoid having vectors and matrices excessively allocated on a heap and keep all the math local. Using Vector Register looks like a weird almost assembly style language, but initial analysis has demonstrated it to be fast with no unintended GC impact.
