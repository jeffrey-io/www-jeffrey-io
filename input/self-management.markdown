The problem of my adult life is a management problem. I have too many creative aspirations, and I lack time. Perhaps, I should learn patience.

## Context

Here are all the things I want to do outside of work:

* make all the furniture at my house
* do the landscaping for my house
* write my second novel that is less terrible than my first
* actually launch the open source product
* get a garden going that is productive (yielding brocolli, carrots, etc...)
* build a woodshed
* chop up two trees to season them (hence the need for a woodshed)
* build a minecart rail from future woodshed to near house.
* build all the outdoor furniture
* build a forge
* learn metal workinging
* learn how cars work
* buy a beat up truck and make it better
* write essays on life
* start running marathons
* stop being weak

## Essential Energies

The way I see it, I have three forms of energy:

* Mental
* Physical
* People

My work tends to spend most of my mental energies, and some of the people energy. This means that the things I do outside of work tend to be physical.

## Clustering the Creative Forms

I'll take the above list of things I want and identify the major themes and associate their respective energies:

* making with wood &#8594; [10% mental, 90% physical]
* making with metal &#8594; [10% mental, 90% physical]
* making code &#8594; [99% mental, 1% physical]
* making with land &#8594; [1% mental, 99% physical]
* writing &#8594; [99% mental, 1% physical]
* exercise &#8594; [10% mental, 90% physical]

If you noticed, none of the above themes have any energy dedicated towards people. The new question is how do I leverage people to help with the above efforts.

## Leveraging Others

So, the open question is whether or not I'm willing to pay others to help with my creative aspirations. I think I am, and I will spell out the first level.

### Making with Wood

It would be nice to have someone help with:

* cleaning the shop after I'm done
* help carry larger items
* plane and sand pieces

I like the routing and assembling phase.

### Making with Metal

No idea, I haven't even started. I imagine that it will follow a similar pattern with wood.

### Making Code

This one is tricky since I'm very picky with my code. I think my best bet here is to get an apprentice. This will require more thinking.

### Making with land

This is the most simple to solve since I can hire people to do the landscaping. The other question is whether or not I want to spend the money on it.

### Exercise

I should hire a personal trainer to help learn how to make the most of my time.
