# Post-mortem

Well, 2014 finished, and I got some things done.

# The setup

As many of you know, I'm now a home owner. With my home, I have a garage that I'm turning into my manly man cave of building builderdom. You can see images of the initial transformation here:

* Step I: [Getting the Walls Ready](http://images.jeffrey.io/man-cave-build-out/) - I wanted to paint the pale yellow-ish walls with white. The reasoning is two fold: (a) it looks better, (b) glossy white reflects more light and more light makes for better safety.
* Step II: [Get Wood](http://images.jeffrey.io/my-stiff-wood/0002/)
* Step III: Build First Mega Workbench. [The design](http://images.jeffrey.io/mega-tatbles/0002/) and [the results of the first build](http://images.jeffrey.io/first-mega-workbench/0002/)
* Step IV: Build Another Workbench. 
* Step V: Hook up Workbenchs with suction for dust and to make cleaning easier **Failed**

Once the above steps are completed, the chaotic garage can start to get some order. Once the garage is operational, I'll start on my projects:

# Done
* Mega Workbench Mark I
* Mega Workbench Mark II
* Mega Desk Mark I
* A Rack to hang brooms on
* Mega Railing
