December 1, 2014 was my last day at Amazon S3. I joined March 28, 2011 and witnessed tremendous growth. I left as [a senior software engineer](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreymbarber), and I was with <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com">Amazon S3</a> since around four hundred billion objects, and I helped shipped several public features:
* [server side encryption](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2011/10/04/amazon-s3-announces-server-side-encryption-support/)
* [object expiration](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2011/12/27/amazon-s3-announces-object-expiration/)
* [glacier archival](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/11/13/amazon-s3-now-supports-archiving-data-to-amazon-glacier/)
* [cors support](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/08/31/amazon-s3-announces-cross-origin-resource-sharing-CORS-support/)
* [website redirects](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/10/04/web-page-redirects-on-amazon-s3-hosted-websites/)
* [website routing rules and root domain support](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/12/27/root-domain-support-on-amazon-s3-hosted-websites/)

I ended working on stuff that I couldn't talk about.

The core reason that I left was that I had a sense of closure. The most recent launch of [event notifications](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-event-notification/) was the last feature I wanted from S3 so that I could build more stuff on top of it. Combine this with the launch of [lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and I'm as happy as a dead pig in the sun.
