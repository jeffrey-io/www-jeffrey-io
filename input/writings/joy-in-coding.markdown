I have been slinging code since I was six years old. It started by simply transcribing games from BASIC COMPUTER GAMES (pictured to the right). I'm nearing my mid thirties with practically three decades of exposure to computers, and it still doesn't get old.

This website you see before you is a simple set of text files that I store in git-hub. I wrote some code to take these text files, process them, connect them, and upload to S3. Sure, I wrote yet another static site generator [wake](https://github.com/jeffrey-io/wake). Spending the two days I worked on this code brought me joy.

I can see myself slinging code until the day I die.

The nice thing about joy is that it need not be explained. It lives in the unquantifiable parts of the human soul.
