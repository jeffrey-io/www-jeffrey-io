Lately in life, I have come to fully understand what it means to be gifted, born with privilege, fully execute on that privilege, and experience a more than fair share of luck. I’m successful and happy, and I find myself wondering “what is next?”

I see two paths ahead of me. The first path is the path of “greedy white guy”. This path requires me pushing my success to the next step, and really just accumulate assets. The second path is “pillar of the community”.

The way I have stated the paths along with the title indicates I am leaning towards being a “pillar of the community”.

The next question and focus of my soul searching for 2016 is “what does that mean?”
