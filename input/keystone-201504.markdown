The goal for this april is eliminate explicit sugar from my diet. You may wownder what I mean by "explicit sugar"? I mean things like cookies, scones, ice cream, and other such sweet things. I call this out because there is sugar it many things like bbq sauce.

Since I am essentially starting fresh, I also explicitly plan to enjoy other carbs like pastas or starchy potatoes. I think everyone would agree that a pound of potatos is better than a pound of cookies.

*Goal:* No sweet cookies

# 4/11 Update

Well, the good news is that I've lost around five pounds. I am also not suffering, so I should be able to complete this month without any problems.

Also, I'm not eating too many extra carbs, so this has helped as well. It has been nice to have the occasional pasta or grain when it is available.

# 4/20 Update

So, this evening I learned that I can, in fact, still eat a whole large pizza. I do not advise doing so as I lost all weight loss progress. However, it was delicious.

# 4/27 Update

Wow, this is hard.

# 4/30

Well, I made it... that sucked.

# Slip ups

* a sausage and cheese scone
* a jolly rancher
* an entire large all meat with extra everything pizza?

# In conclusion.

I started with a weight in the range of 405 to 410 lbs, and I ended with a weight in the range of 392 to 397. I am happy with that for a month. So, what's next?
