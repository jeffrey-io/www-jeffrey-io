The goal for this may is to converge to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-Carb_Diet">slow carb diet</a>. Specifically, my goal is to enjoy a few (but finite) number of sweet things on friday and saturday. On friday, only allow some carbs but no explicit sugars. Then, monday through wednesday I will have no carbs beyond what is allowed on the slow carb diet. On thursday, I'll allow myself some carbs in the form of asian noodles.

My goal is to try to balance a bit of joy with a bit of intensity. I found the slow carb diet too intense when I was exercising, and this threw me off course. The ravenous hunger after seven miles consumed me. If I can satisfy the intense hunger and desires on thursday through sunday without over indulgence, then maybe I can endure three days.
